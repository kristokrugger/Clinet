# CliNet
A web application for a walk-in clinic.

# Description:
Clinic staff will be able to login to access as well as modify patient information, and patients at 
the clinic will be able to login to request and view appointments. For instance, receptionists will 
be able to record new appointments and modify existing ones, add new patients to the clinic’s database 
and modify their basic information such as address and phone number, record the reason
for patients’ visit including symptoms and other special requests, record patients’ lab results, etc. 
Doctors will be able to login to access and modify a patient’s medical record, write prescriptions, referral
forms, and lab forms for patients, etc. Technicians will be able to login to access and
modify equipment status; for example, they’ll be able to see if all of the clinic’s
equipment is currently operational and whether or not any of the equipment needs
maintenance or replacement. Patients will be able to login using the web application to
set up new appointments specifying the date, doctor, the reason for their visit
(symptoms), and any special requests.
